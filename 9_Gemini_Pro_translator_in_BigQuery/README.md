The Gemini-Pro LLM model is now available in BigQuery ML. Hereâ€™s how to use it.

BigQuery (GCP's data warehouse) lets you analyze data and run machine learning models, including large language models like me (powered by Vertex AI).


Step 1: Create a BigQuery dataset (guide). my dataset is named playground_us.

Step 2: Create a Vertex AI connection (guide) .

Step 3: Create model like:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `vl-data-learn.vertex-ai`
  REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `eu.vertex-connection`
OPTIONS (ENDPOINT = 'gemini-pro')
```

Where:
`vl-data-learn` - dataset
`vertex-ai` - model name
`eu.vertex-connection` - region & connection name

For the purpose of test Gemini as translator I used Lithuania traffic violations dataset where need translate laws names to english.

```
SELECT 
  STRING(ml_translate_result.translations[0].translated_text) AS Translation,
  text_content as Original
FROM
(
  SELECT * FROM ML.TRANSLATE(
  MODEL `raw_data.vertex-ai`,
  (SELECT ank_straipsnis_pav AS text_content from raw_data.road_violations limit 20),
  STRUCT('translate_text' AS translate_mode, 'en' AS target_language_code))
)
```
