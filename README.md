## Data Enginnering
There is data engineering projects / learnings completed on free time.

1 - Homeworks of data engineering (Big data) trainings

2 - Exploring Apache Airflow (based on training course)

3 - Data engineering with GCP (Airflow, PostgressSQL, Data Lake, BigQuery, Dataproc, GCP Composer)

3.1 - Data engineering with GCP (PostgreSQL, Spark, Data Catalog)

4 - Lithuania statistics pipeline. Project to get data from Statistics Lithuania and store it in GCP Storage.

5 - Dashboard about Lithuania transport market (cars, motorcycles, ships), pipeline build using GCP tools: Storage, Bigquery, Dataflow, Dataform, Looker Studio

6 - Simple web app to see the best times to watch planes in Vilnius International Airport (VNO) spot. Tools: Python, Flask and deployed on GCP App Engine.

7 - Python and Rust performance for Data Engineering comparison.

8 - Real-time data pipeline using Rust in GCP. The pipeline utilizes Pub/Sub. The ingested data loaded into BigQuery.

9 - Example how to use Gemini Pro as a text translator in BigQuery.
